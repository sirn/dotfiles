Troubleshoot a problem by researching the error and proposing a minimal fix.

## Process
1. Identify the error message, log, or failure symptom from the user's request or context
2. Research the error:
   - Search the codebase for related code paths and error handling
   - Check documentation for the libraries/frameworks involved (use WebSearch/WebFetch)
   - Search the web for known issues, fixes, or similar error reports
3. Analyze the root cause based on research findings
4. Propose a minimal fix

## Output
1. **Likely cause**
2. **Evidence** (links or doc references)
3. **Fix**
4. **Verify**
